                        <h2>Organic Research</h2>
                        <p><b> Organic search indicates that results from a search were not affected by paid advertising but rather how they relate to the search term</b>. This is unlike paid search which is determined by how much advertisers are willing to pay for improved positioning. Organic ranking is important because 75 percent of users do not click past the first page of results (webfx.com). This means that if a web page is not ranking highly or on the first page more than likely it won't receive much traffic. Over 40 percent of revenue is captured from organic search traffic which makes it helpful marketing for businesses.

It is important to know where your website ranks with certain keywords and what keywords are best for improving ranking.
