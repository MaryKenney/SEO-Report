                                  Along with page optimization, there are other ways to improve page ranking. One of these ways is from creating a blog. Blogging is a great way of getting people to engage with your site. Building a base of faithful readers can lead to your website gaining daily traffic and eventually improving ranking. Another way to increase ranking is to ensure that the website is readable. This means writing the text and content in a way that is easily readable and understandable for the user. Along with the testimonials page, video interviews and reviews of patients' experience with the SmileNinja could be beneficial for increasing the time viewers stay on the page.<br>

                                <li>
                                  Building backlinks within the local area is more important than generating those outside of it since these would be the potential customers. One of the best ways to improve local inbound links would be traditional grassroots marketing. This would include getting involved in the community and building relationships with other businesses in the area.
                                    <ul><br>
                                            <ul>

                                                  There are a couple of beneficial ways to build these local relationships. One of them would be supporting a cause or charity that is important to your business and in return asking organizers if they would be willing to link your website.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                  Another way to improve local backlinks would be getting more connected with blogs in the area and asking them to write about your business in exchange for products or service.
                                                </li>
                                                <li>
                                                  Based on the businesses that compete with SmileNinja, 400 high-quality inbound links is our set target to stay competitive. While generating a multitude of inbound links is important, focusing on the quality of those links is just as crucial.

                          <ul>
                              <li>
                                Making sure the bounce rate is low is important for search engine rankings. A poor user experience will lead to them clicking off of the website faster which eventually leads to lower rankings.

                          </ul>

                          <h3>Check for keyword cannibalization</h3>
                          <ul>
                              <li>
                                Checking for keyword cannibalization means to make sure that you are not trying to optimize one keyword on multiple pages. This leads to google struggling to decide which page should rank the highest and may cause pages to compete against each other.
